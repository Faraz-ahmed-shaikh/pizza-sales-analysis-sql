📊 Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL

This project analyzes a multi-table pizza sales dataset using PostgreSQL to uncover revenue trends, product performance, demand patterns, and operational insights.
The goal is to transform raw transactional data into clear, business-ready intelligence through well-structured SQL analysis.

🔍 Project Overview

This analysis explores how different pizzas, categories, sizes, and time periods contribute to overall business performance.
Using SQL joins, window functions, CTEs, and aggregations, the project answers key operational and revenue-driven questions relevant to real retail businesses.

📁 Dataset Structure
The relational database contains four connected tables:
orders – order timestamps and IDs
order_details – line-item records with quantities
pizzas – size, price, and pizza type
pizza_types – name, category, and product details
These tables form a complete transactional workflow for sales analysis.

🎯 Business Questions Answered
This project focuses on questions that matter to actual businesses:
Which pizzas generate the highest revenue?
What products dominate sales volume?
What are the peak ordering hours for staffing and promotions?
Which pizza sizes and categories drive customer demand?
How does revenue accumulate over time?
What is the contribution percentage of each category?
These insights help guide menu planning, inventory strategies, and operational decisions.

🧠 Key Insights
✔ Top Products:
High-performing pizzas and categories drive the majority of revenue, supporting smarter product focus.
✔ Peak Hours:
Clear lunch (12–14) and dinner (17–19) peaks reveal where operations should allocate staff and promotions.
✔ Size Preferences:
Large and Medium pizzas dominate ~70% of sales, showing strong preference for shareable and value-based portions.
✔ Revenue Momentum:
Cumulative revenue shows steady growth without drop-offs, reflecting stable demand patterns.

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical SQL skills and the ability to convert transactional data into clear, actionable business insights.
It reflects real analytical thinking used in retail decision-making and forms a strong foundation for deeper data analytics and business intelligence work.
